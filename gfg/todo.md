Top 50 Array Coding Problems for Interviews - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-array-coding-problems-for-interviews/

# Searching
- search in sorted rotated array
- square root
- search in infinite sized array
- meridian of 2 sorted array
- repeating element (floyd's slow-fast algo)
- allocate minimum pages

# Sorting
- merge sort
- quick sort
- kth smallest element
- chocolate distribution problem
- merge overlapping intervals
- meeting the maximum guests
- radix sort

# Hashing
- Subarray with zero sum
- Longest subarray with given sum
- Longest consecutive subsequence
- more than n/k occurences(try with moore's voting algorithm when n is large and k is small)

# String
- leftmost repeating character
- rabin-karp algorithm
- kmp algo algorithm
- check if strings are rotation
- lexicographic rank of a string
- longest substring with distinct character
