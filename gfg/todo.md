Top 50 Array Coding Problems for Interviews - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-array-coding-problems-for-interviews/

# Searching
- search in sorted rotated array
- square root
- search in infinite sized array
- meridian of 2 sorted array
- repeating element (floyd's slow-fast algo)
- allocate minimum pages

# Sorting
- merge sort
- quick sort
- kth smallest element
- chocolate distribution problem
- merge overlapping intervals
- meeting the maximum guests
- radix sort

# Hashing
- Subarray with zero sum
- Longest subarray with given sum
- Longest consecutive subsequence
- more than n/k occurences(try with moore's voting algorithm when n is large and k is small)

# String
- leftmost repeating character
- rabin-karp algorithm
- kmp algo algorithm
- check if strings are rotation
- lexicographic rank of a string
- longest substring with distinct character

# LinkedList
1. Implement double and circular linked list with tail pointer
2. find middle of linked list
3. nth node from end of linked list
4. reverse linked list(try recursively)
5. reverse linked list in groups
6. detect loop
7. detect and remove loop
8. even odd segregation
9. pairwise swap of linked list
10. lru cache

# Stacks
1. Implement K stacks in an array
2. stock span problem
3. largest rectangle area in histogram
4. largest rectangle with all 1's
5. design a stack with getmin()

# Queue
1. Implement stack using queue and queue using stack(check gfg practice for variations of this problem)
2. generate numbers with given digits

# Deque
1. Implementation using circular array
2. first circular tour

# Tree
1. Print nodes at k distance
2. level order
3. level order line by line
4. check for balanced binary tree
5. convert binary tree to doubly linked list
6. construct binary tree from inorder and preorder (binary tree from inorder and postorder possible)(binary tree from postorder and preorder not possible)
7. tree traversal spiral form
8. diameter of a binary tree and (after this)
9. iterative inorder

# Binary Search Tree
1. insert
2. delete
3. AVL tree
4. red black tree(java TreeMap and TreeSet uses Red Black tree)
    ```
    So if your application involves many frequent insertions and deletions, then Red Black trees should be preferred. And if the insertions and deletions are less frequent and search is the more frequent operation, then AVL tree should be preferred over Red Black Tree.
    ```
5. rewatch application of bst
6. find kth smallest in bst
7. check for bst
8. fix a bst with 2 nodes swapped

# Heap
1. build heap
2. heap sort
3. sort a k sorted array
4. k closest elements
